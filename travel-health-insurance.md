# Medical features

#### Potential coverage

- You can save a lot of money by purchasing a plan that focuses mostly on medical coverage rather than broad coverage.
- Overall medical coverage limit
- Non-emergency medical care
- Outpatient Dr's visits (Primary care physician, dermatologist, etc.)
- Physical therapy, e.g. 6 visits per trip <$100
- Urgent care and emergency room
- Prescriptions
- 24/7 assistance
- Emergency transportation, e.g. Evacuation
- etc.

#### Not covered

- Buying a plan for domestic travel within your country of residence if your current domestic provider offers a plan with out-of-state/nation wide coverage, e.g. Having an HMO plan in California and buying a travel insurance plan for Texas is likely not covered.
